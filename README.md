**_What_**

Had to make a contact form that sends and cleans emails, names and messages and that will arrive on my personal inbox configured with phpmailer connected with google smtp to send an email.

**_objective_**

The objective of this challenge is to give you the opportunity to learn PHP by solving a real life need: processing a contact form. Because HTML is good to create the visual interface of the form, but you will need a backend script to actually process the data and compose the email message to be sent to the client. The project is consistent and introduces many interesting problems for your learning.

**_Learning Objectives_**

Thanks to this project, you can learn the following :

    Backend: A basic but real-life form processing: sanitization > validation > execution > feedback
    Backend: create a function that displays all error messages above the form
    Git: useful Readme file
    Backend : deploy on Heroku
    (bonus) Backend: Use third-party dependencies (php classes)
    (bonus) backend : Use of an external SMTP server to send emails

**_how_**

I started with looking up how I make a form with php that will send my emails and messages
secondly I started my researh on php form

**_Self-Evaluation Criteria_**

   [x] When one submits the form, you receive an email with the form content to my email address
   [x] Most PHP code is above the html doctype line
   [x] All PHP variable names are explicit and consistently named
   [x] PHP contents as little comments as possible, but as much as necessary
   [] DRY: repeated instructions are wrapped into custom PHP functions
   [x] If one forgets the email address or the message, the proper feedback message is displayed and no email is sent
   [x] If one enters an incorrectly formatted email message, the proper feedback message is displayed and no email is sent
   [x] If there are more than one error, all error messages are displayed in one html (un)ordered list (above the first question in the form).
   [x] If one enters some javascript code in any input field, the javascript is removed
   [x] The HTML is valid html5, as per the W3C Validator
   [x] The HTML is accessible, as per the Web Accessiblity Checker online tool.
   [x] The Git Repository Readme file is useful (what / why / when / who / where)
